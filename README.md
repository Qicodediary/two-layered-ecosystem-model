# two-layered-ecosystem-model
This GitHub repository accompanies the manuscript of Zheng et al. titled “A two-layered ecosystem model for the stratified ocean”. It includes a Jupyter notebook (run_model_concentration.ipynb) which shows the defined two-layered ecosystem model with output in concentration, and how to run this model at the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study site (BATS) location using Python coding language. As in run_model_concentration.ipynb, the other Jupyter notebook (run_model_stocks.ipynb) shows the defined two-layered ecosystem model with output in stocks followed by an example to run the model at BATS. This model requires a set of input parameters (saved in parameter_input.csv) and also needs the mixed layer depth data at BATS (saved in forcing_MLD.csv) as a forcing.

The notebook can be run through a webpage, just click on the launch-binder image.
