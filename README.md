# two-layered-ecosystem-model
This GitHub repository is associated with the manuscript by Zheng et al., titled “A Two-Layered Ecosystem Model for the Stratified Ocean.” 

The repository contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how to run the two-layered ecosystem model developed in the study. 

The first notebook, run_model_concentration.ipynb, illustrates the model's output in terms of concentration and provides a step-by-step guide to running the model at the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) location using Python. 

Similarly, the second notebook, run_model_stocks.ipynb, presents the model's output in terms of stocks and includes an example of its application at BATS. 

The model requires a set of input parameters, provided in parameter_input.csv, and needs mixed layer depth data from BATS, stored in forcing_MLD.csv, as a forcing.

The notebook can be run through a webpage, just click on the launch-binder image.
